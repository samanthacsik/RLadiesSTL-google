## Teach Me How to Google, Practice Problems

Flex your Googling and problem-solving skills by working through a set of three coding challenges included at the end of the slide deck, [Teach Me How to Google](https://samanthacsik.github.io/teach-me-how-to-google/slides/RLadiesSTL-2022-02-22.html#1). 
All three problems can be found in the [practice_problems.Rmd](https://github.com/samanthacsik/RLadiesSTL-google/blob/main/practice_problems.Rmd). Feel free to **fork** and **clone** this repository to use that `.Rmd` as a workbook.

To do so, you'll need to have (a) R/RStudio and git installed on your computer, (b) a GitHub account, and (c) a couple R packages installed. You can find instructions on how to get everything you need installed and working below:

* [Install R & RStudio](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KLYC_GcDLYeczSjJmZ5h4y525XILJbbL6r2-MxGCdtw/edit)
* Install the necessary packages by running the following line in your RStudio console (if you do not already have them installed):
  + `install.packages(c("tidyverse", "palmerpenguins"))`
* [Setup git & GitHub](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AQ4zAYxPHOObq-snnnRtEdwCC8TwIJsTHwpaKyvEyoA/edit)
* [Fork & clone a GitHub repo](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16aM5B4B3WRc1YbcYrFlk_IOX1YV5ITnMWxNpCQFb8Qk/edit?usp=sharing)

*If you prefer to avoid using GitHub altogether, you can download `practice_problems.Rmd` [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BWnd91BjSeVNQuegi4ExmVvk-L_l0Hzu/view?usp=sharing), save it to your computer, and open it up with RStudio to start coding! Make sure to install the `{tidyverse}` and `{palmerpenguins}` packages still, if you don't have them already.*
